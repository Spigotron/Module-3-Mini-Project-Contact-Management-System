2. Edit an existing contact
This command allows the user to edit any detail of a contact that already exists in the CMS.

3. Delete a contact
This command allows the user to completely remove a contact from the CMS.

4. Search for a contact
This command allows the user to search by full name for a contact in the CMS; if the search is successful, all of that contact's details will be displayed.

5. Display all contacts
This command displays a list of all contacts in the CMS, along with all of their details.

6. Export all contacts to a text file
This command exports a structured list of all contacts in the CMS, along with all of their details, to a text file ("Contacts.txt") in the same folder as the application.
